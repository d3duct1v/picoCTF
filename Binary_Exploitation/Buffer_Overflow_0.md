#### Description
> Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/173/vuln). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/173/vuln.c).  Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Solution
Download the two files; one is C code, and the other is the compiled program.  Let's start with the C code.

After reading through the file, we found a print statement requiring a flag.txt file to be within the directory. If you are completing this challenge locally, create the `flag.txt` file with touch: `touch flag.txt`.  
> [!NOTE]
> Ignore the text file if you started the instance and have the Netcat command showing in the description.

After analyzing the C code, the challenge's title is Buffer Overflow.  Let's find our buffers.  We have two buffers, first line 17 `char buf2[16]`, and line 39 `char buf1[100]`.   The user input controls both of these buffers (line 37 `printf("Input: ")`).   Let's connect to our server with netcat:

Seeing `buf2` only allows 16 characters, let's pass 17.

That worked!
Overflowing `buf1` would require 101 characters to overflow.
