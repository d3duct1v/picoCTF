#### Description
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511
## Solution
Open the URL in a new tab and open the Inspection tool.  

The Inspector tab shows the landing page of the target website. Expanding the code reveals a comment with the first part of the flag.

Returning to the webpage's head section, we see two more files referenced in the same directory as this landing page: `mycss.css` and `myjs.js`.

Let's inspect the CSS file:  Use the Style Editor tab to inspect `mycss.css`.  There is another comment at the bottom of the file.

Finally, let's look at the `myjs.js` file: Using the Debugger tab, load `myjs.js` file.  There is part 3 in the comment at the bottom of the file.
