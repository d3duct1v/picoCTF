#### Description
> Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474
## Solution
Loading the website we are greeted with a message with _Where are the robots?_.  Let's go to the robots page and see what we can find.  Add `/robots.txt` to the end of the URL.

We now have a new URL to try to load, let's see if we get blocked, replace `robots.txt` with `477ce.html`.
