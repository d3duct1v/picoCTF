There's something in the [building](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/011955b303f293d60c8116e6a4c5c84f/buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?
## Solution
Download the file and check the file type.

[stylesuxx](https://github.com/stylesuxx) created a [steganography](https://github.com/stylesuxx/steganography) tool hosted [here](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/)

Upload the PNG file on the decode part of the tool.
